The formula for exponential growth is `population_size = N0 *e**rt`, where `N0` is the initial population, `e` is the exponential function, `r` is the rate, and `t` is time. Using this:\n","\n","1.   Set the initial population, `N0`, as 100 and the growth rate, `r`, as 0.4\n","2.   Use the suitable `numpy` function to generate an array of time points, `t`, which go from 0 to 10 seconds, in 0.2 second increments.\n","3.   Write an expression to evaluate `population_size`, which should be an array of the population size for each time point in `t`.\n","4.   Create a new variable called `population_size_noise`, use the same expression you wrote in parts (3), and add noise to the population at each time point. Do this by adding an expression that uses a `numpy` function to generate a random value for each time point drawn from a normal distribution of `mean=0` and `stdev=250` (i.e., population_size_noise = expression_from_part_a + expression_to_add_noise)."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Population size is:  [ 100.          108.32870677  117.3510871   127.12491503  137.71277643\n","  149.18246976  161.60744022  175.06725003  189.64808793  205.44332106\n","  222.55409285  241.08997064  261.16964734  282.92170144  306.48542033\n","  332.01169227  359.66397256  389.61933018  422.0695817   457.22251951\n","  495.30324244  536.55559711  581.24373944  629.6538261   682.09584693\n","  738.90560989  800.44689143  867.11376585  939.33312874 1017.56743061\n"," 1102.31763806 1194.12644178 1293.58173155 1401.32036077 1518.0322245\n"," 1644.46467711 1781.42731796 1929.79717555 2090.52432351 2264.63796432\n"," 2453.25301971 2657.57726999 2878.91908792 3118.69581683 3378.44284638\n"," 3659.82344437 3964.63940726 4294.84259788 4652.54744398 5040.04447781\n"," 5459.81500331]\n","Population size with noise is:  [  88.54289469  467.13517451  335.86217359  410.63053039  -59.42131968\n"," -210.2900669   451.82890128 -119.30209299 -483.91347218   60.37029949\n","  413.9376165   569.83483034  159.77257388  583.90581612  307.24747811\n","  325.40510336  208.82879038  471.32989924  555.9229974   657.44898188\n","  498.92779276  618.60935615  294.62237496 1071.42619004  521.71837169\n","  916.63302146  806.89807204  712.90127831 1255.82834883 1012.76038415\n"," 1129.13508483 1075.28898973 1251.55180703  876.73963804 1717.38663099\n"," 1596.80791987 1706.94107674 1990.31701281 2320.087327   1984.03310633\n"," 2840.04130665 2406.28232896 2637.91677301 2954.95794656 4051.83488626\n"," 3602.64418246 4489.57968581 4362.22801593 4558.5179089  5341.70521412\n"," 5120.11788836]\n"]}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","#set initial population\n","N0 = 100\n","#set growth rate\n","rate = 0.4\n","#create array of time points \n","t = np.arange(start=0, stop=10.2, step=0.2)\n","\n","#calculate population of colony at the time points in t\n","population_size = N0 * np.exp(rate*t)\n","print('Population size is: ',population_size)\n","\n","#add noise to population at each time point\n","population_size_noise = N0 * np.exp(rate*t) + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=250, size=np.shape(population_size))\n","print('Population size with noise is: ',population_size_noise)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["<details>\n","  <summary>Answer</summary>\n","\n","  ```python\n","  import numpy as np\n","\n","  #set initial population\n","  N0 = 100\n","  #set growth rate\n","  rate = 0.4\n","  #create array of time points \n","  t = np.arange(start=0, stop=10.2, step=0.2)\n","\n","  #calculate population of colony at the time points in t\n","  population_size = N0 * np.exp(rate*t)\n","  print('Population size is: ',population_size)\n","\n","  #add noise to population at each time point\n","  population_size_noise = N0 * np.exp(rate*t) + np.random.normal(loc=0, scale=250, size=np.shape(population_size))\n","  print('Population size with noise is: ',population_size_noise)\n","  ```\n","</details>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"QmxvYhS3OCNJ"},"source":["### 2.
